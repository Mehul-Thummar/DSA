==> space complexity.

    ==> Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory 
        space used by an algorithm/program, including the space
        of input values for execution.

==> Time complexity.

    ==> Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken 
        by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of
        the input.
